> As an example scenario, consider a home security company that monitors 100,000 homes. Every minute, it gets data from various sensors such as a motion detector, door/window open sensor, glass break detector, and so on, installed in each home. The company provides a web site for residents to monitor the activity of their home in near real time.
> 
> Each sensor pushes data to an event hub. The event hub is configured with 16 partitions. On the consuming end, you need a mechanism that can read these events, consolidate them, and dump the aggregate to a storage blob, which is then projected to a user-friendly web page.

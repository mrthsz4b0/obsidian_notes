cards-deck: üî∑AZ-204::Develop event-based solutions
---

- event-driven, reactive programming
- publish-subscribe model
- publishers don't know how the events are handled
- Subscribers decide on which events they want to handle.
- Uses [[üè´Knowledge Center#Exponential backoff]|exponential backoff]]

# 1 Events
- size up to 64 KB is covered by General Availability (GA) Service Level Agreement (SLA) #limitations
- Events over 64 KB are charged in 64-KB increments #fees

# 2 Topics
- an endpoint where the source sends events
- used for a collection of related events
- publisher creates
- publisher decides whether an event source needs one topic or more than one topic
	## 2.1 System topics
	- provided by Azure services
	- You don't see system topics in your Azure subscription ^755b9f
		- because the publisher owns the topics
	- As long as you have access to the resource, you can subscribe to its events.

	## 2.2 Custom topics
	- When you create or are assigned access to a custom topic, you see (<->[[#^755b9f|here]]) that custom topic in your subscription.
